Now you've created a team, it is time to create your first monitor.

After accessing the dashboard for the first time, you will be welcomed by a prompt asking you to go to your monitor list. From here, you can create your first monitor.

When you click the "Create a monitor" button, you will be shown a modal to create your first monitor. You can choose between a simple HTTP monitor or a more advanced TCP monitor.
