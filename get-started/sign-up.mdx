## Create a new account

Let's get started by creating a new account. After creating an account, you will be able to create a new team and try Spectate for free for 10 days.

In order to create an account, simply visit [https://app.spectate.net/register](https://app.spectate.net/auth/register) and fill out the form.

<Tip>
    You can also create an account using your existing Google, GitHub, or Microsoft accounts. This way you don't have to verify your email address.

## Verify your email address

After creating an account, you will receive an email with a verification link. Click on the link to verify your email address.

After verifying your email address, you are good to go.
