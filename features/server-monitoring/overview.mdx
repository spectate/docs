## What is server monitoring?

Instead of monitoring the health of individual applications, server monitoring is about monitoring the health of the underlying infrastructure that supports those applications. This includes any Linux machine (like a server or IoT device) that make up your infrastructure.

## Hosts

Hosts are servers, virtual machines, containers or any other physical or virtual machine that runs your applications. You can monitor various metrics about your hosts, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage using the Spectate Agent.
