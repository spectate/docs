## Smart incident merging

For more information on smart incident merging, see the [dedicated page](/features/incident-management/smart-incident-merging).

## Incident resolve grace period

To prevent flapping monitors from creating and resolving incidents too quickly, Spectate has a grace period for resolving incidents. This grace period is set to 5 minutes by default, but can be adjusted to your liking.

## Route recovered alerts

By default, Spectate will send a recovered alert to the same channel as the incident was created in. If you want to send recovered alerts to a different severity route, you can do so by selecting the severity from the dropdown.
