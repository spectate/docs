## What is an incident?

An incident is a single event that has caused a disruption to the normal operation of a service. They are created automatically when a service is detected as being down and are resolved when the service is detected as being up again.

Using incidents, you can collect information about what happened, how it was resolved, and how long it took to resolve. This information can be used to improve your service and to create reports for your customers.
