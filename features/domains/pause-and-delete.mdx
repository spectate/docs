## Pause a domain name

If you want to temporarily pause checks for your domain name, you can do so from two places:

### Pause a domain name from the list

Click on the three dots next to the domain name you want to pause, and select **Pause**.

</Frame>

### Pause a domain name from the domain name settings page

Go to the domain name's settings page. You will find the **Pause** button at the bottom of the page, above the danger zone.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/domain-name-settings-pause.png" alt="Pause a domain name from the domain name settings page" width={400} height={200} />
</Frame>

## Delete a domain name

If you want to delete a domain name, you can do so from the domain name's settings page. You will find the **Delete** button at the bottom of the page.

Deleting a domain name will also delete all of its associated data, including the domain name's history of incidents.

This action is irreversible.
