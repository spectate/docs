## What is domain name monitoring?

Domain name monitoring allows you to monitor the status and health of your domain names.

To monitor domain names, we use the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) to query the registry for the domain name's status and health. The registry is the organization that manages the domain name's top-level domain (TLD). For example, the registry for the .com TLD is Verisign.

## How frequently are domain names monitored?

Domain names are monitored every 4 hours starting from the time you add them to your account.

## Supported TLDs

An up to date list of supported TLDs can be found here: [https://deployment.rdap.org/](https://deployment.rdap.org/).
