## Prerequisites

First, you have to create a webhook in Teams. You can find a guide on how to do that [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams,dotnet#create-an-incoming-webhook). These integrations are called "Connectors" in the Microsoft Teams app.

## Setup

1. Go to [Integrations](https://app.spectate.net/integrations) and click on `Configure` in the Microsoft Teams card.
2. Paste your webhook URL and click `Save`.
3. You can now send a test notification to make sure everything is working.
