## Prerequisites

First, you have to create a webhook in your Discord server. You can find a guide on how to do that [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

## Setup

1. Go to [Integrations](https://app.spectate.net/integrations) and click on `Configure` in the Discord card.
2. Paste your webhook URL and click `Save`.
3. You can now send a test notification to make sure everything is working.
