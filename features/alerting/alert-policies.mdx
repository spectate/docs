Alert policies allow you to connect integrations to your monitors and define the severity that will send a notification to the specified integration.

### Configuration

You can configure alert policies by clicking on the "Alert policies" tab in settings.
This is supported by all types of monitors, such as monitors, domains and even status page events.
