## Setting a secret

To set a secret on your status page, go to the Security settings and enter a secret.

## How to access your status page?

There are two ways to access your status page.

### 1. Authentication screen

If you have set a secret on your status page, you will be redirected to the authentication screen when you visit your status page.

### 2. Direct link

You can also access your status page directly by adding the secret to the URL. For example, if your status page is at https://status.example.com and your secret is `password`, you can access your status page by visiting https://status.example.com?secret=password.
