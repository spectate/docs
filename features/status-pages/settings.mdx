There are various options that you can adjust to change the way how your status page looks and behaves.

## General

### Title

The title of your status page. This is the title that will be displayed in the browser tab.

If you don't have a [logo](/status-pages/branding#logo), this will also be the title that will be displayed in the header.

### Slug

The slug is a unique identifier that you can use to access your status page if you don't have a custom domain.

For example, if your slug is `my-status`, you can access your status page at `https://my-status.spectate.page`.

## Content

### Return URL

The return URL is an optional setting that will add a "Return to website" button to the top of your status page.

This button will redirect users to the URL that you specify here.

### Support email

The support email is an optional setting that will add a "Report an issue" button to the top of your status page.

This button will open the user's default email client and pre-fill the email address that you specify here.

### Subscriptions

See [Subscriptions](/status-pages/subscriptions).
