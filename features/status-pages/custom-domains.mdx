It is possible to use a custom (sub)domain for your status page and is a great way to brand your status page.

Make sure you have a registered domain and have access to the DNS settings of the domain.

## How to set up a custom domain

1. Go to the **Settings** page of your status page and scroll to the **Custom domain** section.
2. Enter the domain you want to use and click **Save**.

## Configure your DNS

Once you have set up your custom domain, you will need to configure your DNS to point to Spectate.

This is done by adding a CNAME record to your DNS settings. The CNAME record should point to `cname.spectate.page`.

An example of a CNAME record for the domain `status.spectate.net` on Cloudflare:
