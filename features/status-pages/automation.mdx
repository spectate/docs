## What is automation?

If you have created [components](/features/status-pages/components) for your status page which are linked to a monitor, you can use automation to automatically create incidents reports and update them when the monitor changes state.

## Enabling automatic updates

When automatic updates are enabled, for every monitor that is linked to a component, an incident report will be created when the monitor changes state. The incident report will be updated when the monitor changes state again.

This is useful so that you can keep your status page up to date without having to manually create incident reports.

### Down message

When a monitor changes state to down, the incident report will be created with the message you have set as _Down message_.

### Recovered message

When a monitor changes state to up, the incident report will be updated with the message you have set as _Recovered message_.

## AI generated incident reports

    AI features are only available in the **Pro** and higher plans.

When automatic updates are enabled, you can also enable AI generated incident reports. This means that when a monitor changes state to down, an incident report will be created with a message generated by our AI. The message will be based on the actual incident that caused the monitor to change state to down.

### Flow

AI generated incidents not only just generate a message, but also improve the flow of keeping track of the incident.

- When an incident is detected, AI will generate a message based on the actual incident and create an incident report in the **Investigating** state.
- If a successful heartbeat is detected again, AI will generate an update and move the incident report to the **Monitoring** state.

Now, two things can happen:
1. If the monitor changes state to down again, AI will generate an update and move the incident report to the **Investigating** state again.
2. If the monitor remains up for at least 15 minutes, AI will generate an update and move the incident report to the **Resolved** state.

This way, you have automated incident reports that are always up to date and that follow a logical flow.
