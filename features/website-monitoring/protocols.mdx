Monitors are not just simple website uptime checkers. They can be used to monitor any kind of service, including APIs, TCP services, and more.

## Available protocols

Please refer to the list below for the available protocols. Not all checks are available for all protocols.

### HTTP

HTTP checks are used to monitor websites and web applications.

SSL certificate checks are not available for HTTP checks. If you need to check the validity of the SSL certificate, please use choose HTTPS instead.

### HTTPS

HTTPS checks are used to monitor websites and web applications that use HTTPS. They are the most common type of check.

The difference between HTTP and HTTPS checks is that HTTPS checks use SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection between the monitor and the target.
Performance metrics will include the SSL/TLS handshake time.

SSL certificate checks are also available. They can be used to check the validity of the SSL certificate.

### ICMP (Ping)

ICMP checks are used to check the availability of a host. They are the most basic type of check.

_More supported protocols are coming soon._
