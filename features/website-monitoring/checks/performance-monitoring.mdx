With performance monitoring, you can monitor the performance of your website or application even more closely. This is useful to detect performance issues before your website or application becomes unavailable.

## Notifications

### Hard performance threshold

If your monitor's response time exceeds the hard performance threshold, you will be notified instantly whereas the average response time is calculated over a longer period of time.

### Average performance deviation

If your monitor's response time is higher than the average of the comparison interval, you will be notified. You can set the baseline and comparison interval in the settings. The defaults are 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively.

## Configuration

Performance monitoring is enabled for all websites and applications and can be disabled. You can configure the following settings.

### Enable performance monitoring

You can enable or disable performance monitoring for your website or application.

### Hard performance threshold

You can set the hard performance threshold in milliseconds. If your monitor's response time exceeds this threshold, you will be notified instantly.

The default value is 5000 milliseconds.

### Average performance deviation

This is the deviation percentage which will be tolerated. If the average response time exceeds the deviation percentage, you will be notified.

The default value is 100%.

### Deviation baseline interval

This is the period of time in which the average response time is calculated. The default value is 15 minutes.

### Deviation comparison interval

This is the period of time in which the average response time is compared to the baseline. The default value is 2 hours.
