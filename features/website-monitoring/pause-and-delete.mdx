## Pause a monitor

If you want to temporarily pause a monitor, you can do so from two places:

### Pause a monitor from the monitor list

Click on the three dots next to the monitor you want to pause, and select **Pause**.

</Frame>

### Pause a monitor from the monitor details page

Go to the monitor's settings page. You will find the **Pause** button at the bottom of the page, above the danger zone.

</Frame>

## Delete a monitor

If you want to delete a monitor, you can do so from the monitor's settings page. You will find the **Delete** button at the bottom of the page.

Deleting a monitor will also delete all of its associated data, including the monitor's history.

This action is irreversible.

You won't be able to re-add the same URI for some time until all data has been cleaned up.
