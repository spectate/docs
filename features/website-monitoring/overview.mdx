## What is a monitor?

Monitors are a way to check the health of your application. They are a way to check if your application is running, if it is responding to requests, if it is responding to requests in a timely manner, and if it is responding with the correct data.

You can not only monitor just your website, but also entire API's, TCP services, and more.
